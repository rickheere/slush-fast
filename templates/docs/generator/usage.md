## Usage

### Project types

For now this generator produces two different types of projects, targeted at scaffolding angular modules and its moving parts.

- Scaffolding only - Exactly what it says: scaffolding only of angular modules and module parts.
- SPA - Single page application with all the bells and whistles

In then near future more options are planned, first up is the ability to create angular module-type projects, targeted at creating single purpose modules like directives or services.

### Initialize a new project

```
mkdir yourproject
cd yourproject
slush fast
```

You will be prompted for input on project type, name, etc. Upon finishing the generator will create a project layout for you.
