# Installation

Install the development tools you need for scaffolding, bear in mind these tools need to be installed globally, for *nixy systems you might want to use `sudo` or take a [look here](http://howtonode.org/introduction-to-npm) for npm without sudo.


```
$ npm install -g slush
$ npm install -g git+<%= slush.npm.repository.url %>

```
