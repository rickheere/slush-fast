## Install prerequisites

- [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
- [Ruby Programming Language](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and [Sass: Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [node.js and npm, its package manager](http://nodejs.org/)

If you have created this project by using the `slush-fast` generator, you probably already have all `gulp` and `slush` installed,
in which case you don't have to do anything.

If you just checked out this project you need some tools to help you run this project.

- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) - The streaming build system
- [Slush](http://slushjs.github.io/) - Gulp as a replacement for Yeoman

These tools are installed using `npm`, the node package manager, bear in mind these tools need to be installed globally, for *nixy systems you might want to use `sudo` or take a [look here](http://howtonode.org/introduction-to-npm) for npm without sudo.
